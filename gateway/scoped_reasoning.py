"""Preserve explicit gateway reasoning overrides across runtime route changes.

Channel- and session-scoped reasoning are more specific than per-model/global
configuration. Provider fallback and same-turn model switching both call the
shared ``resolve_reasoning_config`` chokepoint, so a scoped value must survive
those re-resolutions for the rest of the turn.

This module keeps the scope marker on the reasoning-config object itself. That
avoids a second mutable flag on cached agents: when the gateway refreshes an
agent for an unscoped turn it assigns a normal ``dict`` again, automatically
restoring the existing per-model fallback behaviour.
